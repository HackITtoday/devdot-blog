## What We Have Learned It Is

## Back to the Future

Remember when you first started in web design and you used Notepad ++. 

Your first

 '<h1>Title</h1>
  <p>Hello World</p>'
  
How simple is was. How you could create content easily and show the world. Then it got more and more complicated and you got further and further from those simple times. Well you an get back that again. You can create your own HTML tags and extend tags that already exist. You can code

'<paper-tabs></paper-tabs>'

and tabs which are designed and which just work on any screen and any browser just appear. No jquery, no javascript, no css, no mediakit. Nothing. It just works and everyone who did just the first small steps in HTML can understand it. 

Well that's the power of it. Not just that it does not conflict with anything else in the page. All the test is inside that tag that you need. It even works offline. The power of that is incredible. That is what this could lead to. A simplier world.



### It is a framework and not a library
